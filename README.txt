The JavaScript in this document is all my original code.

The way that the instructions are displayed on the webpage is inspired by the Challenge Project: Number Guesser from Codecademy : https://www.codecademy.com/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/becp-22-javascript-syntax-part-i/modules/wdcp-22-number-guesser/projects/number-guesser-independent-practice

You need to be connected to the internet for the webpage to work because I import the jQuery library from Google Hosted Libraries.
